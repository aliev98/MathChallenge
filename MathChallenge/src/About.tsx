              Begin by viewing a series of basic math expressions, solve each expression and remember the order they were shown.

             After the expressions are displayed, you'll see the answers but not in the same order.
             Your task is to enter the answers in the same sequence as the original expressions.

             As you progress through the levels, the expressions are shown more quickly, increasing the difficulty and testing your ability to recall and arrange answers.
